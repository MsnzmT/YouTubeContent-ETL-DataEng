# YouTube Content Management Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building a robust data pipeline for managing and analyzing YouTube content data. The project is divided into two phases, each with specific goals and deliverables.

## Phase 1: Data Pipeline Setup and Management
The primary objective of Phase 1 is to establish a comprehensive data pipeline for processing and analyzing pre-extracted YouTube data. Key tasks include:

1. **Data Preparation**: Work with pre-extracted YouTube data (no APIs are used in this phase).
2. **Database Setup**: Configure and set up PostgreSQL and MongoDB for structured and unstructured data storage.
3. **Data Loading**: Load the pre-extracted data into the databases using various methods.
4. **Workflow Management**: Use Apache Airflow to orchestrate and manage the data pipeline workflow.
5. **Data Analysis**: Transfer the processed data to ClickHouse for efficient and scalable final analysis.

## Phase 2: Automation and Analytics
In Phase 2, the focus shifts to enhancing the pipeline and providing actionable insights through automation and visualization. Key tasks include:

1. **Process Automation**: Implement automation to streamline data processing and reduce manual intervention.
2. **Incremental Processing**: Support incremental data processing to handle updates efficiently.
3. **Analytical Dashboards**: Build interactive dashboards using Metabase to visualize insights and trends from the analyzed data.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, ClickHouse
- **Workflow Management**: Apache Airflow
- **Data Visualization**: Metabase
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Other Tools**: Docker
